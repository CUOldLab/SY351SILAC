Description: A data package for the phosphoproteomic and proteomic data sets published in Poss, ... Old, Taatjes and scientists at Syros, using the Syros' CDK7 inhibitor SY-351. HL-60 cells were treated with inhibitor, followed by SILAC (Light:Heavy) phosphoproteomics and proteomics analysis with TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment and multidimensional
